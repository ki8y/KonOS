# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
If you somehow stumbled upon this repo by chance, PLEASE do not use Kon OS just yet. I haven't tested it yet, it's probably very unstable.
...Like seriously, I'm not even done the readme.md file yet. I just put this here just in case.

# Kon OS - An automated PC optimization tool
Kon OS is a customizable, easy to use, open-source optimization tool for Windows 11. It prioritizes high performance, privacy, and customizability.

## Usage:
- First, the PowerShell execution policy must be set to `Bypass`.
```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope LocalMachine
```
- Then, you can install Kon OS by running this one liner:
```ps1
Invoke-WebRequest "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ki8y/KonOS/experimental/KonOS11/irmtest.ps1" | Invoke-Expression
```
